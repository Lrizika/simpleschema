TODO list:
- Improve documentation
	- Top Priority!
- Add custom exceptions
	- Look into automagically appending key/value info, rather than adding it manually every time
- Add tests
- Add support for applying schemas to objects
	- Probably add a custom flavoured dict for this?

Bugs to fix:
- None currently known!
	- I suspect this will change once I add tests
